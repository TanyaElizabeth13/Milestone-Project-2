#### User Stories

**First time users:**

As a first time user of the game, I want to be able to put my name into the game as the player.

As a first time user of the game, I want to be able to start the game easily.

As a first time user of the game, I want to easily understand the rules and aims of the game. 

As a first time user of the game, I want to be able to play the game bug free. 

As a first time user of the game, I want to be able to play the game on whatever screen size I may be on. 


**Returning users:**

As a returning user of the game, I want to be able to start the game again.

As a returning user of the game, I want the matches to reshuffle so I am not playing the same cards again.

As a returning user of the game, I want my lives to reset when I replay the game. 

**Site owners:**

As an owner of the game site, I want to promote healthy eating for children

As an owner of the game site, I want to teach children about vegetables with simple facts.

#### Site structure

The site will have a very simple and easy to navigate structure as it is aimed at children.

The header of the page will contain the heading and subheading.

Then there will be a section containing an image of the game mascot and some text with him introducing the user to the concept of the game. 

The game area itself will have a colourful background and the 12 game cards set out over 3 columns and 4 rows. 

On smaller screens, under the game section, will be a text area containing randomly generated facts about fruit, veg, and nutrition. These will be on the right of the game on larger screens.  

The footer of the page will just contain the copyright information.

#### Wireframes

![wireframephone](../docs/imgs/phone.png)

![wireframepad](../docs/imgs/pad.png)

![wireframedesktop](../docs/imgs/desktop.png)

#### Colours

![colourscheme](../docs/imgs/colours.jpg)

41AC3C (Green Pantone) is used for the main header of the page and the backs of the cards in the game section. It is also used for the button text both on the main page and the custom 404 page. 

90E274 (Light green) is used for the subheading. 

465438 (Rifle green) is used to contrast the brighter greens. It is used for text throughout the project. 

Black is used to make certain point on the page stand out, the 'lives left' text and 'click me' button are important information that users need to see clearly. 

White space is used on the page to give a clean look to the game and make sure the rest of the colour scheme looks more vibrant. 

#### Typography

All fonts used are imported and sourced from Google fonts. 

**Gluten**

![glutenfont](../docs/imgs/glutenfont.jpg)

Gluten is used for the main heading of the page to create a memorable logo for The Veg Heads! brand. It is also used for the character name cards within the game.

**Hachi Maru Pop**

![hachifont](../docs/imgs/hachifont.jpg)

Hachi Maru Pop is used for the subheading and the ‘lives left’ text. It is a fun font that gives the page a bit of whimsy. 

**Poppins**

![poppinsfont](../docs/imgs/poppinsfont.jpg)

Poppins is used for paragraph text throughout the site. It is an easy-to-read font but still ties in with the aesthetic of the game. 

#### Imagery 

**Character - The Veg Heads!**

![mascotveg](../docs/imgs/veg.jpg)

The Veg Heads! are fictional character based on this free image found on freepik. The image was separated into the individual characters for use in the match game.

**Mascot - Tommy Tomato**

![mainmascot](../assets/images/tommy-tomato.jpg)

The main mascot is the tomato character, he was chosen as the main one to stand out against the green tones across the page.

**Non character cards**

![cardfronts](../docs/imgs/cardfronts.jpg)

The matches for the character cards are their names, these where made in gitpod and screen grabbed. 

**Game background**

![vegbackground](../assets/images/veg-background.jpg)

The game board background is a hand drawn vegetable free background from vecteezy. It is muted enough on colour as to not make the game area hard to see. 

**Favicon**

![favicon](../docs/imgs/favicon.jpg)

The site icon is a small tomato sourced from Icons8. 

#### Design differences

Originally the plan was to move the ‘did you know?’ and ‘lives left’ section to the right of the game board on larger screens. After trying this out the idea was dropped as it made the site look messy and asymmetrical, which didn’t go with the minimalistic style of the site. Instead the layout is kept the same as on smaller screens. 

The ‘did you know?’ section was originally intended to generate a random fact every time the game was restarted. The idea was replaced with a ‘click me’ button that generates the facts instead, this increases the interactivity of the site and encourages the users learning.

This project was initially created in Github using the Code Institute’s full template

Version control was accomplished through the use of Github by pushing to the repository using the following:

Git add was used to stage files before committing.
Git commit -m was used to add commit messages.
Git push was used to push code to the repo.
The project was then deployed using Github Pages by doing the following steps:

Open repository
Click Settings
Click Pages on the left-hand side
In Source select deploy from branch
Select correct branch and root
Click save
Once generated click the link to the live site
